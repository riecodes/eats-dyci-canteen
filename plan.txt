Canteen Management System CSS & Design Revision Plan
====================================================

1. Adopt a Modern CSS Framework
   - Choose and integrate Bootstrap 5 (or Tailwind CSS) as the base framework.
   - Remove legacy/custom CSS that duplicates framework features.

2. Define a Design System
   - Establish a color palette (primary, secondary, success, danger, etc.).
   - Select fonts and set base typography rules.
   - Define spacing, border-radius, and shadow standards.
   - Document button, input, card, and badge styles.

3. Componentize the UI
   - Identify and refactor repeated UI blocks (sidebar, navbar, tables, modals, forms, badges, cards).
   - Use PHP includes/partials for shared components.
   - Standardize markup and classes for each component.

4. Make the Layout Responsive
   - Use the framework's grid and responsive utilities for all layouts.
   - Ensure tables, forms, and modals work on mobile and tablet.
   - Add horizontal scrolling for wide tables on small screens.

5. Improve Accessibility & Usability
   - Use semantic HTML elements and proper label associations.
   - Ensure color contrast meets accessibility standards.
   - Make all interactive elements keyboard accessible.
   - Add focus states and ARIA attributes where needed.

6. Visual Polish & Consistency
   - Add subtle transitions/animations for modals, buttons, and hover states.
   - Use icons for actions and status (Bootstrap Icons or FontAwesome).
   - Add whitespace and consistent padding/margins.
   - Remove all inline styles; use classes/utilities instead.

7. Organize and Optimize CSS
   - Create a single custom.css for overrides and unique styles.
   - Use clear, maintainable class naming (BEM or utility-first).
   - Remove unused or redundant CSS rules.

8. Test and Iterate
   - Test all pages on major browsers and devices.
   - Get feedback from users and stakeholders.
   - Iterate on design based on feedback and usability testing.

Next Steps:
- Confirm framework choice and design direction.
- Begin with a sample page refactor (e.g., dashboard or orders page).

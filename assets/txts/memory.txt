**Summary:**
- Core setup, authentication, user/stall management, and UI/UX foundation are in place.
- Major missing areas: product/order/payment flow, seller/buyer features, announcements, analytics, file uploads, and some security/backup features.
- Next steps: Prioritize implementation of seller and buyer features, order/payment flow, and announcement system.

=======

**Note:**
- Never use static data for canteen, stall, or product selection. Always use dynamic data from the database. Order placement flow should be a dynamic single page.

**Recent Changes:**
- Implemented full buyer order flow: dynamic canteen > stall > product selection, session-based cart, order placement, and order limit logic.
- Added buyer order tracking and receipt upload (buyer_orders.php).
- Integrated seller-side order management: view orders, verify receipts, approve/decline, and mark as done (seller_orders.php).
- All logic is pure PHP, single-page, no AJAX.
